# Git-Theta docs

This directory contains the code for building `git-theta`'s documentation.
Specifically, it builds the documentation for the Python library, not the command line utilities.
The individual submodule files can be regenerated by running
```
sphinx-apidoc -o source git_theta
```
This must be done whenever a new submodule is added or an existing submodule is renamed.
